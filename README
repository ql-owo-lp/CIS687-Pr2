## Overview =======================================
This is a program which analyze the dependency relationship among code files.

## Commands ======================================

./Debug/Exec.exe [\R] "Directory path" [file pattern: "*.cpp", "*.h" etc.] [file pattern 2] ...

By specificing \R, we will search sub-directories under the path specificed.

If not specific file pattern, *.h will be used by default

## NOTES =====================================
This program basically can read and distinguish every variable and types, also distinguish the
variable effective scope.

For example, when a type "A" is defined in file1.h, a type also named "A" is defined in file2.cpp,
even if file2.cpp includes file1.h, it will not be recognized as file2.cpp depends on file1.h, as it does
not use the "A" defined in file1.h

This program also distinguishes nested structure such nested namespace and class.

Also, this program checks only include file instead of all files.  Thus it is more precise.

Due to above features, this program runs a little bit slower as its result is more accurate.
